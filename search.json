    "text": "Where do my interest lie?\nI am an ardent admirer of the complex modal architecture of Raags and their nuanced affective properties, from the therapeutic cadences of Yaman to the devotional dichotomy of the Bhairavs. A reverence starkly belied by my own vocal deficiencies.\nA similar analytical proclivity drives my deconstruction of theological frameworks, approached without dogmatic adherence. My own convictions are empirical and mutable, yet this objective lens consistently reveals a unifying tenet across scriptures: magnanimous inclusivity. 😄\n\n\nWhen should you contact me? 😉\nLet discourse reside solely in mathematics—rigor as truth, clarity as beauty, elegance as law. The coffee function endures only as jest. Let the first vector be cast, and the sequence of ideas unfold without bound.\n\n\nSome special quotes that changed my life\n\n\nपिताहमस्य जगतो माता धाता पितामहः वेद्यं पवित्रमोङ्कार ऋक्साम यजुरेव च ॥\n\n\nIt means that the Supreme Personality of God-Head is the father, mother, the grand-parents, and the only thing to be known in this world. It is the embodiment of the pur syllable of OM-kara and the Rik, Sama and Yajur of the Vedas.",

How do I use them ?\nPrimarily crafted for the mathematically inclined 🧠, this toolset is ideal for penning articles and books on Mathematics and its mischievous offspring, Applied Mathematics (aka Physics) 💥. No offense to any field, of course! 😇 Physics, bless its chaotic heart ❤️, keeps mathematicians on their toes with its constant demand for elegant solutions to messy real-world problems 🤯. Otherwise, we’d all be stuck proving theorems in a vacuum 🕳️, and frankly, that sounds terribly dull 😴.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🚀 Simple Steps to Get Started\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Download the Files\nHead over to the GitHub repository and download the .sty files. You can either clone the repository or directly download the files you need.\n\n\n2. Place the Files in Your Project\nMove the .sty files to the same directory as your LaTeX project (where your .tex file resides) or a folder included in your LaTeX path.\n\n\n3. Include the .sty Files in Your Document\nTo use the .sty file, include it in your LaTeX document with the \\usepackage command.\nExample Files - - - GitHub repository\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💡 Pro Tip\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re frequently using these .sty files, consider adding them to your LaTeX distribution’s local path for easy access across all your projects.",
