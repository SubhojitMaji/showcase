So please do try it before looking at the solution, it is easy‚Ä¶\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Solution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe only positive integers not in \\(S\\) are \\(1\\) and the set of numbers divisible by \\(5.\\)\nA lemma to start with: if \\(n\\in S,\\) then \\(n+5k\\in S\\) for all \\(k\\in\\mathbb{N}\\) We get then by the steps \\(n\\to (n+5)^2\\to n+5,\\) repeated as many times as needed.\nBased on that lemma, we make cases in the argument for each residue class mod \\(5.\\) We see right away that if we don‚Äôt already have a multiple of \\(5,\\) we‚Äôre never going to get one. Beyond that, to show the claim stated above, we must show that \\(2,3,4,\\) and \\(6\\) must be in \\(S.\\) We already have \\(2\\in S\\) as given. We have the chain \\(2\\to 49\\to 54^2.\\) Note that \\(54^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{5},\\) which gives us all larger numbers that \\(\\equiv 1\\pmod{5}.\\) One such larger number is \\(2^{16}=256^2.\\) That gives us \\(256^2\\to 256 \\to 16\\to 4.\\) From \\(4\\) we have \\(4\\to 9\\to 3.\\) From \\(16\\) we can get to \\(16+5\\cdot 4=36,\\) and then \\(36\\to 6.\\) Hence we have all of \\(2,3,4,\\) and \\(6\\) in \\(S\\) and \\(S\\) must be as claimed.\nWe do note that the only way to go from a larger number to a smaller number is to go from \\(n^2\\) to \\(n.\\) But \\(1^2=1,\\) so there is no way to get \\(1\\) from a larger number.",
