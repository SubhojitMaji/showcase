I was born into a sweet family in 2005 üçº, in Asansol, India. üåè\nI‚Äôm known for my sense of humor ü§≠ and enjoy engaging in fun, lively interactions with people. During my free time, I love diving into the world of coding üë®‚Äçüíª‚Äîa passion I discovered shortly after my first semester at ISI. From experimenting with algorithms to building small projects, coding feels like both a playground and a puzzle to me.\nMy primary research interest is Probability Theory üìä, where I‚Äôm constantly fascinated by the beauty of randomness and structure. That said, my curiosity isn‚Äôt limited‚ÄîI love exploring various mathematical and computational ideas, which keeps my learning journey vibrant and rewarding.\nBeyond academics, I enjoy connecting with like-minded peers, brainstorming innovative ideas, and occasionally indulging in hobbies that make life more colorful! üé®‚ú®",

Beyond that, to show the claim stated above, we must show that \\(2,3,4,\\) and \\(6\\) must be in \\(S.\\) We already have \\(2\\in S\\) as given. We have the chain \\(2\\to 49\\to 54^2.\\) Note that \\(54^2\\equiv 1\\pmod{5},\\) which gives us all larger numbers that \\(\\equiv 1\\pmod{5}.\\) One such larger number is \\(2^{16}=256^2.\\) That gives us \\(256^2\\to 256 \\to 16\\to 4.\\) From \\(4\\) we have \\(4\\to 9\\to 3.\\) From \\(16\\) we can get to \\(16+5\\cdot 4=36,\\) and then \\(36\\to 6.\\) Hence we have all of \\(2,3,4,\\) and \\(6\\) in \\(S\\) and \\(S\\) must be as claimed.\nWe do note that the only way to go from a larger number to a smaller number is to go from \\(n^2\\) to \\(n.\\) But \\(1^2=1,\\) so there is no way to get \\(1\\) from a larger number.",
