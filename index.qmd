### Where do my interest lie?

I really like to listen to *Classic Songs(Retro Music)*. Though, I would really laugh hard if somebody bared with my voice for 30 sec. I really like to read about various religious thoughts, understand their belief structure. I quoted a Sanskrit text at the end doesn't make a blind follower of any religion. My views tend to change based on facts but there is something that I felt to be important to every religious belief is that they promote inclusive thoughts in these texts. Yeah!! Thanks for reading this... :smile:

### When should you contact me? :wink: 

If you ever feel like that you want a new friend :smile: or just want to chat, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to chat and connect with you but please keep it **Mathematical** ! :wave:

Also you may [**buy me coffee**](https://buymeacoffee.com/subhojitmaji) sometimes to keep me awake(**Kidding **!!):smiley:

    It means that the Supreme Personality of God-Head is the father, mother, the grand-parents, and the only thing to be known in this world. It is the embodiment of the pur syllable of OM-kara and the Rik, Sama and Yajur of the Vedas.
