### Some special quotes that changed my life

> "‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§π‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§ú‡§ó‡§§‡•ã ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§ß‡§æ‡§§‡§æ ‡§™‡§ø‡§§‡§æ‡§Æ‡§π‡§É ‡•§

> ‡§µ‡•á‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ç ‡§™‡§µ‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ã‡§ô‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∏‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§Ø‡§ú‡•Å‡§∞‡•á‡§µ ‡§ö ‡••"

It means that the Supreme Personality of God-Head is the father, mother, the grand-parents, and the only thing to be known in this world. It is the embodiment of the pur syllable of OM-kara and the Rik, Sama and Yajur of the Vedas.
