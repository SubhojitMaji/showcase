## Story Time :grin:

I had to work on the UDGRP Projects of Winter 2024 and there I had to use a lot of latex and make Beamer files and Latex Notes and while there were ample number of templates on OverLeaf but it seemed too boring and it lacked the personal touch I wanted to give to my presentations. So, I decided to create my own sty theme and customize it according to my preferences. :smile:

## FAQ :confused:

### Q. How do I use them ?

Primarily crafted for the mathematically inclined 🧠, this toolset is ideal for penning articles and books on Mathematics and its mischievous offspring, Applied Mathematics (aka Physics) 💥. No offense to any field, of course! 😇 Physics, bless its chaotic heart ❤️, keeps mathematicians on their toes with its constant demand for elegant solutions to messy real-world problems 🤯. Otherwise, we'd all be stuck proving theorems in a vacuum 🕳️, and frankly, that sounds terribly dull 😴.
